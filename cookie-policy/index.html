            <p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of
                the website and refine marketing efforts. These third-party cookies are set by domains other than

            <h2>5. Managing Cookies</h2>
            <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by

                through the browser settings.</p>
            <p><strong>How to manage cookies in different browsers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data</li>
                <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data</li>
                <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences > Privacy > Cookies and website data</li>

            <h2>6. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                want to have your online activity tracked. Currently, there is no standard for how DNT signals should be
                interpreted. As a result, our website does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms.
            </p>
